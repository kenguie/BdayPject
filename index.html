	    Happy Birthday to my loving wife.  I'm so happy that we found each other those few years ago online at <a target="new" href="http://www.okcupid.com">okcupid.com</a>.  Since then, I've been so happy and had so many great times and new experiences with you that I am just amazed when I think about how perfect it all turned out.</p>
	
	    <p class="text2"> Since it's your birthday today and I had time to create a website, I couldn't resist not making one dedicated to you and us.  Wait until you see the future changes.  I'm so excited.  While we are having our new experiences, we'll see this site develop even more.  It will be dynamic.  Every new tool or cool effect will be able to be placed into it.  All our milestones together will also be able to be here as well.  Although it's very simple now, I can't wait to see all the memories we'll be able to add in the future. </p>
	
	    <p class="text3"> I love you, here's to many happy updates!</p>

	    <p class="text4">Who could have guessed years ago of our story.  As I said, it seems like a dream come true.  Meeting in Chicago not even 2 miles away from each other and online when our family's were less than 5 miles away here in New York!  Here we are from when we were just starting out.  In some ways, not much has changed, in some ways, lots of things have changed.  Aren't you excited?  I can't wait to see what happens in our future!</p>
