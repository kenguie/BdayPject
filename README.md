BdayPject
=========

## Inspiration 

For my wife, who's support and encouragement makes me feel like I can do anything.

## Challenges I ran into 

Using current / new / and old knowledge to create a great looking site worthy of being a gift.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 

Stylistically everything in my wire framing and some, shadowing, gradients, and other CSS effects I love. 

## What I learned 

I still remember a lot from my web hosting days, I learn more easily, and I believe I do a great job in a short amount of time.

## What's next for Birthday Gift Project for my wife 

When I have time, I plan to add more effects / pictures / and upgrades ... This is one project I plan to keep updating to practice design so look for changes in the near future.
